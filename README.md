# Directory Reader

Directory reader is a php and javascript directory reader meant to be as minimal as possible.  This is useful if you have your directories hidden through apache but want to show files on a specific folder.

## Installation

This script was meant to have little to no installation.  Drag the index.php into the folder you want to display your files in.  By default it will automatically show all the folders, subfolders, and files.  See the //CONFIGURE lines for additional setup options.
